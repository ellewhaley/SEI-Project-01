## My Game - Space Invaders

link to hosted version ----> 

### Game Overview

* I created my own take on the traditional Space Invaders Arcade game, still inkeeping with the space theme but with my own styling. 



### Controls

* Spaceship movements: :arrow_backward: left, :arrow_forward: right
* Spaceship shooting: [space_bar]

### Game Instructions

* The object of the game is to shoot the invaders with your laser base (spacebar) while avoiding their shots and preventing an invasion (left arrow, right arrow).

* The invaders randomly fire missiles at your spaceship. If a missile hits your spaceship, you'll lose a life.

* If you lose all 3 of your lives, you're spaceship is destroyed and the game is over.

* If you fail to shoot all the aliens before they reach your spaceship, aliens will invade and the game will be over.

* However, If you manage to kill all the aliens before they kill you, you have successfully completed your mission and can return to safety.

### Process

### Challenges
* getting the aliens to move in the right direction
* getting the aliens to die when they were shot - this was the first time I'd used splice effectively
* getting rid of bugs which were caused by the timed intervals. These occured when the game was asked to restart. Probably spent an entire day ironing out these bugs.
* attempted to make the game harder and quicker but this caused bugs too so I decided to take it out as I'd ran out of time and thought that was a challenge to inprove it in the future.

### Wins
* countdown timer
* start & restart pages
* getting the aliens to move as they do in the original game

### Future Features
* leaderboard
* alien bombs to destroy bullets
* more waves of aliens to appear once the first lot are taken out.
* more levels
